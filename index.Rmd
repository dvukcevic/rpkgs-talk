Why this talk?

- Important topic
- A lot has changed since 2011 (the last MelbURN talk about R packages)


What is an R package?

> "Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code." (Hadley Wickham)


Why R packages?

- Easier management, re-use and sharing of code
- Helpful even just for yourself
* Saves time

    - Follow conventions, to avoid having to think about plumbing all the time
    - Quick, easier re-use
    - Quicker, easier, sharing

* Easy to create!  (...with a little help from Hadley)

> "I really should just make an R package with these functions so I don't have
to keep copy/pasting them like a goddamn luddite." (Hilary Parker)

> "R packages are the best way to distribute R code and documentation..." (Karl
Broman)


`functions.R` --- The poor man's R package


Your first R package

1. Create folder structure
2. Move `functions.R` into it
3. Add `DESCRIPTION`
4. Add `NAMESPACE`

    ```
    # Export all names
    exportPattern(".")
    ```

5. Install
6. Use!


Advantages (package vs `functions.R`)

    * Easier to re-use
    * Easier to share
    * Easier to maintain as complexity increases

        - Can split seamlessly into multiple files
        - Can version track separately
        - Can add extra stuff: documentation, tests,... (see later)


`devtools`

```
create()
```


New (package-based, `devtools`-based) workflow

* Main idea: use `load_all()` instead of `source()`

```
# Development
dev_mode()
setwd()  -- ?
load_all()
    Repeat!

# Installation (dev mode)
document()
Update DESCRIPTION
check()
install()

# Installation (normal mode)
undo dev_mode()
install()
```

* Any personal tips?


Documentation


Some important (advanced) concepts

* Namespaces (exporting)
* Dependencies
* Lazy loading


Levelling up

* Testing
* Data & examples
* Vignettes
* CRAN


Tips & tricks, other stuff

* Difference between `library()` and `require()`


Sharing your R package

* What to do before sharing
* Where to share
* How to share
* GitHub


Managing R packages (yours or others)

* Installing packages

    - Locally (e.g. your own)
    - From CRAN
    * `install.packages()` or `R CMD INSTALL` or `install_*` (`devtools`)
    - From GitHub

* Finding all dependencies and installing them

    - `reinstallr()`

* Upgrading packages

    * `update.packages()`
    * `reinstallr` package
    * Upgrading all packages after a major R upgrade (CRAN packages only)

        - `update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE, ask=FALSE)`

* Viewing man pages for packages
