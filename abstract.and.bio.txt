Writing and managing R packages

Do you often find yourself copying and pasting old code into new scripts?  Are you frequently using source() to load shared code and wonder if there is a better way?  Would you like to make your code easier for others (and yourself) to use?  Then it is time to write your first R package!

From the point of view of starting a new project, I will show you how you can use R packages to make your code easier to manage, use and share with others.  Packages can be as simple as a single file of R functions, all the way to a full-blown piece of software complete with documentation, tests, data and examples.  You don't need to use all of the functionality in order to benefit from using an R package.  I will show you how to manage your code and development process easily when using R packages, and how to take advantage of the more advanced functionality as your project matures.
