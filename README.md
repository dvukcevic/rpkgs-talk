# Offline version of the slides

This version is the one that was actually used for the presentation.  Unlike
the [web version][rpkgs-talk], it does not depend on any external files.

The most important difference to the web version was downloading all of the
font files.  I used the [google webfonts helper][gwh] to do this easily, based
on [this answer][a] on Stack Overflow.  To save space, the actual font files
are not included here (this branch is meant mainly for future reference on how
to make offline slides).
